# RandomWalk
Partner Python coding project in Computational Physics.

Random Walk is a random process that describes a path of successive random steps in a mathematical plane. For this project, my partner and I used turtle to show the process of each random walk. The user is able to choose if they would like to see a random walk in a 1D plane or a 2D plane, then they can choose the number of iterations they would like to view. A random choice of either -1 or 1 is made for the movement for each step, and turtle displays the random walk in another window.
